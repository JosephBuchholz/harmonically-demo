# Harmonically Code Demo
This project is refactoring and adaption of my larger project Harmoincally/Musique (https://github.com/JosephBuchholz/musique-website). The project renders a chord sheet using SFML.

# Running The Demo

1. `cmake -B build`
2. `cmake --build build`
3. Then go to `build/bin/Debug` and run `main.exe`
